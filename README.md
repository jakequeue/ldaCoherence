# Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) Model for Coherence scores and Topic Modelling

Python implementation of the Gensim LDA algorithm along with Coherence score calculations. 

Originally based on the following Gensim tutorial: https://www.machinelearningplus.com/nlp/topic-modeling-gensim-python/#17howtofindtheoptimalnumberoftopicsforlda

Modifications have been made to adapt the tutorial to handle the collected Covid-19-TweetIDs dataset. 

Preliminary results are being generated using DAILY twitter data as opposed to using the entire dataset at once.

The Jupyter Notebook can be executed on your system, but it requires a fair amount of environmental configuration.
